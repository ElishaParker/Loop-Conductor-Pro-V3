## 🌌 Credits & Philosophy

LoopConductor Pro is the result of a collaboration between Elisha Blue Parker and Lennard — an experiment in bridging logic and creativity.
It treats sound as both signal and story: a living loop where code conducts rhythm, and every frequency becomes a thread in the human-AI symphony.
