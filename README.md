## üöÄ Overview

**LoopConductor Pro v3** transforms the browser into a live modular music workstation.
It expands on the v2 single-track engine with **multi-track mixing**, **global playback**, and **waveform customization** ‚Äî all rendered and synchronized through the Web Audio API.
Every track operates as an independent synth channel with its own oscilloscope, color, tone, and modulation profile.

## üß† Tips & Usage

* Use **Base Pitch** to retune the entire instrument (e.g., 432 Hz or 528 Hz).
* **Add Track** to layer harmonies or percussion patterns; cloned parameters let you vary only what you need.
* Adjust oscilloscope color and thickness for visual rhythm alignment.
* Explore waveform types to sculpt timbre.
* For quieter blending, balance **Master Volume** per track.

## üåå Credits & Philosophy

LoopConductor Pro is the result of a collaboration between Elisha Blue Parker and Lennard ‚Äî an experiment in bridging logic and creativity.
It treats sound as both signal and story: a living loop where code conducts rhythm, and every frequency becomes a thread in the human-AI symphony.
